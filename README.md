# achievement-tracker
achievement-tracker is a comprehensive platform designed to enhance student engagement and motivation in robotics, coding, and electronics classes.

## Achievement Tracking Feature
One of the primary features developed and implemented in KwattAchieve is the Achievement Tracking feature. This feature enables students to track their progress and accomplishments, fostering a sense of achievement and motivation. By providing a visual representation of their progress, students are encouraged to actively participate and strive for further success.

## Technology Stack
achievement-tracker utilizes the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack for its development. The following technologies have been integrated to ensure seamless communication between the front-end and back-end:

RESTful APIs: The Express.js framework is used to implement and integrate RESTful APIs, facilitating smooth communication between the client-side and server-side components of the application.

MongoDB: As the database management system, MongoDB is employed for efficient storage and retrieval of student records and achievements. Its flexibility and scalability make it an ideal choice for managing large volumes of data.
